I did it!
I've failed...
here!
not here!
I can't take this...
lonely...
don't you dare!
do it!
look carefully
listen carefully
think carefully
this place again?
now the real fight begins
you don't deserve this
keep moving
pull back
give it up
don't give up
help me...
impossible...
bloody expensive...
let me out of here...
stay calm
like a dream...
seems familiar...
are you ready?
it'll happen to you too
praise the Sun!
may the flames guide thee
